This project creates an open-source repository for the home-schooling community to share teaching and learning resources to other home-schoolers.
The published materials may be in a digital form: an e-book, lesson plans, students worksheets, sample answers, etc.
Postings can also be made to advertise teaching materials available for circulation within the community (eg: posters, models/ educational games and manipulatives).

Currently the app only allows text entry into the repo via a form (to insert book title, URL links, description, etc) but eventually I hope to find a modest hosting/streaming service. 
Future addition to the app will be a user login feature (category: normal user vs moderator) and also to include a bulletin board to list events, classes, parent-meetups and excursions.
